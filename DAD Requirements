DAD Requirements
    
    The system will allow for input voltages ranging 5V-12V
          The system's default power configuration will be utilizing a 9V battery
    
    The system will operate as a data acquisition system and will NOT be a flight critical piece of hardware
          The system will include data acquisition methods for acceleration, orientation, and altitude
          The system will be rated for up to 20Gs of acceleration
          The system will be rated for altitudes up to 10,000ft
          The system will write data to a flash chip during flight and log all collected data to a microSD card at later-specified intervals throughout flight 
          
    The system will be programmed with the Arduino IDE
          The system will operate using a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller
          
    The system will be turned on via toggle switch
    
    The system will begin its data logging state with the use of a button switch
          This button will not stop its data logging state, only begin
              Safety of potential vibration induced toggle
    
    The system will offer visual information of its state
          The system will display a SOLID RED LED when recieving power
          The system will display a BLINKING RED LED when actively logging data
          The system will display a SOLID GREEN LED after data has successfully been written to the microSD card
          
    The system will be small enough to fit in a small diameter rocket
          2 in inner diameter
          Length over width
